/** @page example-index Examples
@brief Learn by example to get quickly up to speed.

The examples assume that you have at least basic knowledge about graphics
(what are homogeneous coordinates, what is mesh, vertex, texture...), how
OpenGL works (what are buffers, what is depth test for...) and basics of GLSL
(attributes, uniforms, vertex/fragment shaders...). Deep knowledge of OpenGL
API itself is not required, as Magnum wraps the functionality in its own
classes.

Full source code for all examples is available in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples), see
@ref building-examples for more information. The
[ports branch](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-examples/tree/ports)
contains additional patches for mobile and web platform support that aren't
present in `master` in order to keep the example code as simple as possible.

The following examples explain the basic principles and have fully documented
tutorials:
